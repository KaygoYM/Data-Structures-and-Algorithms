Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C.</br>
This repository mainly aims to realize the commonly used data structures and algorithms in C.</br>
In LINKEDLIST, the basic functions of List are realized and solving the "Josephu-Circle" problem by applying Circular-List.</br>
In STACK, the basic functions of stack are realized and applying the stack structure to solve two simple problems:</br>
"Binary,Decimal,Hex and Octal Convert" AND "Brackets Matching".</br>
In TREE, the focus is mainly on the realization of Binary-Search-Tree and the AVL-Tree.</br>
In HASHING, using Separate List/Chain to realize HashTable.</br>
In HEAP, the realization of the basic Binary-Heap and the Binomial-Heap are included. And because time is quite limited recently, some of the codes are referred from Internet</br>
